=== MODULES ===
AutoResources - module for automatic resource collection on the farm (fish, wood, stones). IMPORTANT: go to the farm manually and check if you have all the tools in your inventory!



=== IMPORTANT ===
* When the bot starts up, the ToW window automatically resizes to 1360x720 and moves to the main monitor (1) in the upper left corner. Don't move the window, resize it, hide or overlap the ToW window with other applications!

* When the bot is running, it controls the character and does its job. At this point, the bot takes control of the mouse cursor. Do not move the mouse cursor while the bot is doing its job, it can lead to errors in the bot!

* The bot uses the coordinate system on which it clicks with the mouse cursor. While the bot is running - any changes in the game window, or movements of the mouse cursor can lead to errors!

* Press the "Q" button if you need to stop the bot.

* After completing its work - the bot stops and closes the console window. After that, you can manually return the ToW window to its original size and position.
